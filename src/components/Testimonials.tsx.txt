    quote: `Before working with Gabriel, I tried a massage therapist specializing in myofascial rehabilitation. After three sessions and a commitment to implementing specific exercises at home, there was little progress. That was exactly the opposite of my experience with Gabriel. After four sessions my lower back and knee pain are gone. My core is stronger. I’m hiking 5-10 miles, up and down stairs without pain, and can go from a sitting position to standing effortlessly.

    Gabriel gave me exercises to implement outside of our meetings, checks to see how things are going, and continually monitors my progress. He is always on time, professional in both his behavior and communication and exercises a great deal of patience. From the results I’ve experienced in such a short time, I highly recommend Gabriel’s services to everyone.`,
